    } (if you need to add more movies, separate them with commas!!!!)

Example:
"23": {
    "name": "Kredwi",
    "year": "2023",
    "description": "Awesome movie for the evening, or maybe the whole day..",
    "image": "DIRECT LINK TO THE IMAGE"
},
"2312": {
    "name": "example",
    "year": "1992",
    "description": "I don't know",
    "image": "LINK TO THE IMAGE"
}

If you're unsure about what a direct link to an image is, please google it.
And please, no hate, I know I'm not good at coding.
